/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The rule is the one the lyrics writer and the voice converter follow on their own: on 24 GB only one large model
/// fits, YuE2, the lyrics model or separation and Seed-VC. Songs and renders go to the worker as soon as neither a
/// draft nor a voice conversion holds the memory; the worker queues them itself and batches what it can. A lyrics
/// draft needs the worker idle as well. Jobs start in order, with one exception that bundles them by model: while
/// YuE2 holds the memory, songs and renders pass drafts waiting ahead of them and go to the worker, which batches
/// them with the songs it has, instead of YuE2 being unloaded for the draft and loaded again after it. That lasts only
/// as long as the draft at the front has waited less than <see cref="QueueOptions.BundleWindow"/>; after that songs
/// wait behind it, so the worker runs empty and the draft gets its turn. Voice conversions keep their own queue
/// (<see cref="VoiceConverter"/>), which waits for the memory in the same way; a version that has waited that long
/// holds back new songs as well. So does a take of the speech lab (<see cref="SpeechLab"/>), for as long as it speaks.
/// Waiting jobs are kept in <see cref="SqliteJobStore"/> and resumed after a restart.
/// <para>
/// Transcriptions run beside YuE2 (SheetSage2 needs about 2 GB and the CPU) but inside the worker's process, which the
/// other models shut down to make room; so a running one keeps them waiting (<see cref="WorkerHost.InUse"/>), and it
/// waits for them in turn. They form a lane of their own: the worker takes one at a time, and one waiting for that does
/// not hold back the songs behind it, nor does a song hold back a transcription. A draft ahead of one does, as it does
/// songs, bundling aside, so that recordings in a row cannot keep the lyrics model out.
