/// The models besides YuE2 share one slot, taken by compare-and-swap, so two of them can never both have it. YuE2 is
/// not in the slot: its worker queues and batches songs itself and announces them through
/// <see cref="WorkerHost.ExpectSongs"/>. Against it the rule is claim, then look: <see cref="TryClaim"/> takes the slot
/// before it checks <see cref="WorkerHost.InUse"/> again, and the queue announces songs before it checks
/// <see cref="Holder"/>, so of a song and a model starting at once one always sees the other. A transcription counts
/// as the worker being in use: it runs inside the worker's process, which a model shuts down to make room.
/// <para>
/// A new model is one entry in <see cref="LargeModel"/>; whoever loads it claims the slot here and the others wait
/// without knowing about it. Changes go into the snapshot (<see cref="StatusSnapshot.Memory"/>), so the browser shows
/// the holder the server decided on instead of inferring it from the stages of everything in the works.
