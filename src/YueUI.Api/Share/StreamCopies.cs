/// The AAC copies the player streams instead of the FLAC. The Mac sits behind a home connection whose upload is a
/// fraction of its download: a FLAC runs at about 1 Mbit/s, which on the road stalled or took long to start, while
/// 192 kbit/s AAC is a sixth of that and sounds the same through a phone. The FLAC stays what downloads, exports and
/// the Logic page use.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Copies live in <c>stream/</c> next to the database (a song's as <c>stream/&lt;run&gt;/songN.m4a</c>, a version's
/// beside its FLAC in <c>versions/</c>), never in YuE Studio's song folder. <see cref="StreamCopyMaker"/> makes them
/// when a song or version is finished; older ones are made on their first play. A render writes the song's FLAC
/// anew in place, so a copy older than its FLAC counts as missing. Without an encoder, or when encoding fails, the
/// caller serves the FLAC as before.
/// <para>
/// A copy carries the song's tags like an export (title, lyrics, style and seed, its own cover), so a file saved
/// from the player or opened elsewhere says what it is. Titles, covers and lyrics change without the audio, so the
/// tags' <see cref="StreamTags.Stamp"/> lies beside the copy (<c>.tags</c>) and a different one tags it again
/// without encoding. Every change goes into a temporary file that replaces the copy, since a player may be reading
/// it. A song without a cover of its own has none in the file: the drawn one exists only in the browser.
