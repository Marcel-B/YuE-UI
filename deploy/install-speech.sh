#   deploy/install-speech.sh           install or update mlx-audio (and PyTorch, for Higgs Audio v3)
#   deploy/install-speech.sh --test    then have every model speak a sentence, which downloads them all (about 28 GB)
#
# Run it on the Mac as the user Tonwerk runs as, after deploy/install.sh. Running it again updates mlx-audio and
