# (Images:Python). The models are downloaded by their first picture, into Images:ModelCache next to it (Klein 4B
# about 15 GB, Klein 9B about 32 GB).
#
#   deploy/install-images.sh    install mflux, or move it to the version pinned here
#
# Klein 9B is gated behind its non-commercial licence: accept it on huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B,
# make a read token for that account and put it into ~/.config/tonwerk/huggingface.token (Images:TokenFile).
# Klein 4B (Apache 2.0) needs neither.
#
# Run it on the Mac as the user Tonwerk runs as, after deploy/install.sh.
